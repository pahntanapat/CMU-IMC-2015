					<p>
						<b>Wat Phra That Doi Suthep</b><br><br>
					Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is a Theravada Buddhist temple in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. It has been a place of worship since it’s former times. The temple is often referred to as "Doi Suthep" although this is actually the name of the mountain where it's located. To reach the pagodas, visitors can walk 309 steps up a cement staircase decorated with seven head Nagas, or take a tram. The Lanna stylized temple above amusingly has a Chiang Saen chedi inside. Outside stands a luxurious stupa covered with two layers of golden leaves. From the temple, visitors can admire impressive views of the city. It might be said that a visit to Chiang Mai cannot be completed without a stop to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep.</p>
					
					<p><b>Baan Mong Doi Pui</b><br><br>
					Baan Mong Doi Pui is located on Doi Suthep-Pui National park. Here, you can visit a museum which illustrates the folkways and flowers seen only in winter. As a highlight, there are bright colorful mong tribe's cloths to try and traditional souvenirs to pick up home.</p>
					
					<p><b>Bhubing Rajanives Palace</b><br><br>
					Bhubing Rajanives Palace is a royal residence located in Doi Buak Ha, Muang District, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Located on Buak Ha Mountain, the climate here is cool throughout the year. The palace was built in 1961 to accommodate the royal family during state visits to the north. There is also a guesthouse for receiving foreign dignitaries. Outside the building, the rose gardens (Suan Suwaree) are particularly famous, and many flowers that cannot otherwise be grown in other parts of Thailand are found here. This place is surely suitable for those who adore fragrant and refreshing flowers and love taking photos.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Suggestion for visiting Bhubing Rajanives Palace</strong><br>
						<ul>
							- Please do not make loud noises which will disturb the others<br>
							- Please wear appropriate clothes. Shorts, waistcoats and sleeveless shirts are not allowed.<br>
							- Keep off the grass and flower beds<br>
							- Do not pick the flowers or do any harm to the garden.<br>

						<p><b>Dara Pirom Palace Museum</b><br><br>
						Dara Pirom was once the palace where Phra Ratchachaya Chao Dararasmi, one of the Royal consorts of King Rama V, lived in. She was a major influence in developing Lanna's handicrafts which has been Chiang Mai’s heritage of pride until today. This building was designed in a western art-and-crafts style. The museum exhibits gracious living quarters, textiles, furniture, person utensils and musical instruments which are related to Phra Ratchachaya Chao Dararasmi.</p>
						
						<p><b>Maesa Elephant Camp</b><br><br>
						Maesa Elephant Camp is the first elephant camp in Thailand. You will be amazed at the abilities of the well-trained elephants. Get to feed the elephants with bananas and sugar cane, and then watch them take their bath before putting on a really entertaining show. The highlight here is a comfortable ride on an elephant through the jungle path.</p>
